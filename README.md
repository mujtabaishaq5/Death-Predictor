# ‚ò†Ô∏è Assembly Death Predictor(Game)

A quirky, fun program written entirely in Assembly language that predicts your "death" based on some inputs ‚Äî just for entertainment and learning low-level programming!

---

## üíÄ What is this?

This project is a simple **Death Predictor** implemented in Assembly. It demonstrates:

- Low-level programming techniques
- Working with user input/output in Assembly
- Basic logic and arithmetic at the hardware level
- Fun with bitwise operations and randomness

If you love Assembly language or want to see how something silly can be done at the lowest level, this is for you!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Runs directly on x86 specify architecture 64-bit
- Takes user input to generate a "death prediction"
- Uses Assembly instructions for all calculations
- Minimal dependencies, runs in terminal/console

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build & Run

### Prerequisites

- NASM assembler installed ([Download here](https://www.nasm.us/))
- A Unix-like terminal (Linux, macOS) or Windows with WSL / Cygwin
- `ld` linker or equivalent

## Example code for understanding:

```asm
section .data
msg: db "Hello World!", 10 ; 10 for newline
msglen equ $ - msg

section .text

 global _start


_start:

   lea rsi, [rel msg]
   mov rdx, msglen
   jmp .print

   ; exit program
   mov rax, 0x2000003
   xor rdi, rdi
   syscall

.print:
 
   mov rax, 0x2000004
   mov rdi, 1
   syscall

```

## How to use colours example: 
```asm

; Remember project is using NASM x86 64bit (Mac convention)

%include "colours.asm" ; import whole file like this

extern red_color, redlen ; import specific things from other .asm files

section .data

  msg: db "Message", 10
  msglen equ $ - msg

section .text

   global _start

_start:

   lea rsi, [rel red_color]   ; specific to Mac
   mov rdx, redlen

   mov rax, 0x2000004
   mov rdi, 1
   syscall
   ; remember if you want any part of the output to be coloured use reset colour after the output otherwise from start
   ; where you will put the redcolour everything will be coloured from onwards

   lea rsi, [rel msg]
   mov rdx, msglen

   lea rsi, [rel reset_color]
   mov rdx, resetlen


   ; print function
   mov rax, 0x2000004
   mov rdi, 1
   syscall


   mov rax, 0x2000003
   xor rdi, rdi
   syscall

; Exit for linux 

   mov rax, 60
   mov rdi, 0
   syscall

; Print for linux
   mov rax, 1        ; write(
   mov rdi, 1        ;   STDOUT_FILENO,
   mov rsi, msg      ;   "Hello, world!\n",
   mov rdx, msglen   ;   sizeof("Hello, world!\n")
   syscall           ; );






```


### Build Instructions

```bash
# Assemble the program
nasm -f elf64 death_predictor.asm -o death_predictor.o

# Link the object file to create executable
ld death_predictor.o -o death_predictor

# Run the program
./death_predictor
